# Contributing to VS Code Elixir Linter

Contributions are welcome. If you would like to contribute to this extension here are some suggestions. :-)

## Report issues

When reporting issues please provide an example, including file snippet if applicable, and an explanation of the expected versus the actual result.

## Feature requests

If you would like a feature added please explain who would benefit from the feature and why.

## Code

To contribute code please use pull requests by following this guide:

- Fork this repository
- Create a new branch from master using the pattern "bug/issue-number" for bugs and "feature/issue-number" for new features. You may optionally add a short description to the branch: for example, "feature/6" or "feature/6-strict-linting". I use [git-extras](https://github.com/tj/git-extras) to make this easier for me, perhaps you may find it useful.
- In your commit message please [mention](https://github.com/blog/957-introducing-issue-mentions) the issue number using "#issue-number": for example, "add setting to enable strict linting. fixes #6".
- Push the new branch to Github and open a pull request (PR). All PRs must pass all current tests and it would be preferred if new PRs included new tests or updates.
